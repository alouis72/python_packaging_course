This repository contains all the stuff for a tutorial that I gave for the CNRS in November 2017. The slides are in French.

The idea of this tutorial was to show to the attendees how to use all the toolchain to package a Python application.

The agenda was the following

- Introduction to setuptools
- Introduction to Pylint
- Introduction to Sphinx, napoleon and nbsphinx
- Introduction to pytest

The final part was dedicated to push the code on github and to use travis, appveyor to automate the tests and deployment of the Python package on PyPi and Conda with binaries for Linux, Mac OS and Windows. The documentation was also update on ReadTheDocs.

The application used during all this tutorial can be found here https://github.com/gouarin/splinart.
